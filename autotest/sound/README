Sounds effects for autotest
http://fozworks.com/2007/7/28/autotest-sound-effects

This plugin triggers sound files for autotest events. 

It requires that you have a command-line mp3 player installed. 
On OSX and Linux, I suggest mpg321, which is available from most package managers (including macports). For fink users, try madplay.

On Windows, try the mplayer command-line app, which can be downloaded from:

 http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/dload.html 

In you ~/.autotest file, load the plugin and set the sounds location:

 require '~/autotest/sound/sound.rb'
 Autotest::Sound.sound_path = "~/autotest/sound/sound_fx/"

If you are on Windows, you will need some additional stuff:

 Autotest::Sound.sound_app = "call c:/mplayer/mplayer.exe -really-quiet"
 Autotest::Sound.process_devnull = "> c:/Windows/Temp/_mplayer_tmp.txt" 
 Autotest::Sound.process_bg = ""

(thanks to John for the Windows info and jinjing for suggesting madplay)

All sounds in sound_fx were created by me, free for your use. See the README and LICENSE in the sound_fx dir.
