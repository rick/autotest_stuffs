Drop this crap in your ~.

Be sure to symlink autotest/sound/sound_fx/current to whichever batch of sounds you want to use (also in autotest/sound/sound_fx/)

Might want to change whichever sound player this uses to actually match what you have installed.

The AUTOLIMIT environment variable controls which tests get run.

I have this function installed in my bash:

function ts {
  AUTOLIMIT=${1:-.} autospec
}
